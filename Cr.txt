Descendant of Ancient Dragons, raised by the Gods. Immortal, which is why he was given the duty to fight the darkness forever.
Apparently, the Abyss nevertheless swallowed him, and Midir suffered a crushing defeat in the endless battle of darkness and light.
At the time of the events, we have to meet a distraught, but still strong enemy, who uses not only fire in battle, but also the magic of the abyss.
You can first meet the dragon if you try to cross the stone bridge located not far from the City Street bonfire behind the wall. To do this, from the fire we pass through the gate, in the open area we turn right.
When attempting to cross the bridge, the dragon will fly close to the bridge, completely covering its surface with fire. In order to safely cross the bridge, you must: 1) provoke Midir to fly by entering the bridge and running back; 2) run to the hole in the rock and hide in it.
You should be careful, because in this hole lives a hollow from the city behind the wall who will try to push you out;
3) run forward and to the left to jump onto the platform below and continue running along it, avoiding enemies.
